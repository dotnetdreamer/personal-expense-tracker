# Open Source Personal Expense💰 Tracker

This is an open source personal expense tracker that lets you log your expenses. You are the owner of your data!

### Why?
Pretty simple, why not?. i wanted to log my expenses under my control! so i created this. It runs everywhere (as a PWA) but you can run it as Hybrid app📱 also as it is built on top of [Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/).
